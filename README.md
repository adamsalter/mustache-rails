Mustache Rails
=========

An attempt to integrate the awesome Mustache template builder by Chris Wanstrath (aka @defunkt) into Rails.

Unfortunately, integration is a work in progress since Rails is quite a large and complicated beast.

If you have any issues please raise a ticket.

Because Mustache forces you to keep all logic out of your template code, it actually changes the paradigm a little. Previously Rails Helpers were a place to put code that didn't quite fit into your view templates exactly, but now, if you have to move _all_ code out of your templates, you will actually find that you require greater code seperation. The current solution is to create sub-modules on the Helpers for each action, as shown below.

Example Usage:
------

app/controllers/pages_controller.rb

    class PagesController < ApplicationController
      def index
        @number = 15
      end
    end
    
app/helpers/pages_helper.rb

    module PagesHelper
      def show_title
        "Generic Page Title"
      end
  
      module Index
        def show_title
          "Index Page Title"
        end
        
        def do_calculation
          @number + 1
        end
      end
    end

app/views/layouts/application.html.mustache

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{{show_title}}</title>
      </head>
      {{{yield}}}
    </html>

app/views/pages/index.html.mustache

    {{number}} + 1 = {{do_calculation}}


There is an example application available in the 'spec/mock_app' directory.

Known Issues:

- layouts not working
- form_for and other helpers are designed to be called within an erb template and therefore need a bit more work. Basic stuff like the calculations above definitely works though.
